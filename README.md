# MachineLearningBasic

The project has 4 parts. Each one requires implementing one ML algorithm from scratch on a specific dataset.

## Linear Regression
**Problem Statement:** To predict density of the wine based on its acidity  <br />
**Dataset:** 
* [Input features](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kgG9ThiUU7lJAAJPsiQbu4wS9szgWiKA) 
* [Target value](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VSjj9Uz0BrJTLIWF8pgq3ywzX6JOsONu) <br />
**Cost/Error function used:** Least squares 
Implemented linear regression using batch gradient descent & least squares method and experimented with different learning rates, plotted diff hypothesis function, contours etc.

## Locally Weighted Linear Regression
**Problem Statement:** To implement locally weighted LR  <br />
**Dataset:** 
* [Input features](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15Al491iBXOiKV9I8qhi5xKpmoIP2kb0E)
* [Target value](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1j7eaCuMemDOmWNdPWD-o7Ak89fuQlUt3)<br />
Implemented the algorithm using normal equations, experimented with different tau values, compared the results with unweighted linear regression.

## Logistic Regression
**Problem Statement:** To classify given data into class 0 or class 1  <br />
**Dataset:** 
* [Input features](https://drive.google.com/open?id=124zwYgyBn7KXc7bgyaVbMoBwG7rEXDbO)
* [Target value](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V1_BR9mq-IQ4TacXWZCEd_B-DxQIJ0-M) <br />
Built a binary classifier from scratch using logistic reg with Newton's method to derive parameters of my model. 

## Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
**Problem Statement:** To seperate salmons from Alaska and Canada (i.e. binary classification)  <br />
**Dataset:** 
* [Input features](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tZSIYOER-IcSQZjaTgsEETi-ElHqUuE5)
* [Target value](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sW0x6IT_UbwRMbxkx3jRZEL1gW1xfMGu) <br />
Built the classifier using GDA to get linear, quadratic decision boundaries and compared the results.
